title: About Me
---

I am a second year uni student currently studying computer science. This website was built to showcase the programming projects I am working on as well as to be a place to put up anything else I feel like.

Here are some random facts about me:
- I've lived in 4 different countries
- My initials are a video game genre
- Alternative rock is the best type of music
- I use Arch Linux (btw)
