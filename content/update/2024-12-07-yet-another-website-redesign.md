The last site lasted only a couple of months...

Hopefully this one will last longer. This time around I used [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) to build the site. It is a really good tool once you figure it out cause after it's fully set up, instead of writing HTML, you will be writing all your webpages in Markdown and have the HTML be auto generated by hugo.

The theme I used as a base was [Hugo-classic](https://github.com/goodroot/hugo-classic). I left most of it the same, just changing the colors and some parts of the header and footer. The colour scheme that the site uses is called [horizon](https://horizontheme.netlify.app/). It is the best colour scheme.

I also started hosting my own [pleroma](https://pleroma.marcusoosthuizen.com/users/mo) instance. With [threads getting more and more integrated with the fediverse](https://www.yahoo.com/tech/threads-now-lets-mastodon-fediverse-122532917.html) and lots of people starting to move to more decentralized social media like bluesky, its never been a better time I think to join the fediverse.

Other than that, see you in the next couple of months when I will inevitably reset my website again and start from scratch.
