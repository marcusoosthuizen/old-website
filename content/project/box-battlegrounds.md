Box Battlegrounds 1 and 2 are a series of games I made during school. The first one was made as part of a game making competition in grade 9 (it won!) and was written using pygame. The second game was just made for fun using lua and love2d.

In both games, 2 players face off against each other on a single computer, one controlling with wasd and the other with the arrow keys. 
The aim is to knockout your opponent by hitting and shrinking them. However, at the same time, there are orbs you can collect that increase your own size. 
The first player to take 3 rounds wins!

There will also be some special effect added to every round after the first one. Some examples of these include gravity, darkness, earthquakes, black holes and flashbangs.
