I'm trying to make a game that uses the classic raycasting technique seen in games like Wolfenstein 3D.
I am not set on almost anything about the game. Not set on the genre, gameplay, story, or anything.

I do have this one screenshot of what I've made so far...

The textures used are not mine. They are from purebdcraft and doom
