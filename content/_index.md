## Hello...

### and welcome to my website!

I am Marcus Oosthuizen and here you can find my various projects, my "blog" and other cool stuff. Yes, my site is meant to look old. The web doesn't need another [bloated website](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvDyQUpaFf4).

Follow me on [YouTube](https://youtube.com/@marcusoosthuizen) for my occasional piano covers and on [GitHub](https://github.com/marcusoosthuizen) for the source code of all my projects.

Enjoy your stay :D
